1.int is for integer. long is just longer but same size as int. Short is for smaller numbers
and long long is used when it is longer than int/long.
float does not have precision compared to double. All bits represent value in unsign but not so in sign.
2. I would use double for rate(there may be decimal as its not an exact value), double for principal(also might have decimal), and float for payment(huge amount)
3. The output is 32, 4393967264, 32, -32, 0, and 0
10. global_str is global variable so it has empty string. global int is global variable so it has value of 0. local_int is a local variable, not initialized, so no value.
local_str is local variable that is unitialized but have value from class.
12. a, c, and d are invalid
13. j is 100
14. the program is legal. output is 100 and 45
17. the code prints 10 10
27.b, c, d, e, and g is legal because it produces the const int
28.a, b, c, and d is illegal ( e is legal because it has pointer to const int)
