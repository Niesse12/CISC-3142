    1.int is for integer. long is just longer but same size as int. Short is for smaller numbers and long long is used when it is longer than int/long.
    float does not have precision compared to double. All bits represent value in sign but not so in unsign.

    2. I would use int for rate(theres no decimal), short for principal(its not as long as long), and long long for payment(huge amount )

    3. The output is 32, 4393967264, 32, -32, 0, and 0
    
    10. The variables in main are not initialized so no intial values.
    
    12. c is invalid
    
    13. j is 100
    
    14. the program is legal. output is 100 and 45
    
    17. the code prints 10 10
    
    27.d and e is legal because it produces the const int
    
    28.a, b, c, and d is illegal
